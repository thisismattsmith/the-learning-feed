Entrepeuner and investor Paul Graham noticed something strange about many of the startup founders he was advising. They were overcomplicating what they were doing by looking for shortcuts and hacks.
\
\
Then it dawned on him. They had learned it in school.

>Why did founders tie themselves in knots doing the wrong things when the answer was right in front of them? Because that was what they'd been trained to do. Their education had taught them that the way to win was to hack the test. And without even telling them they were being trained to do this. The younger ones, the recent graduates, had never faced a non-artificial test. They thought this was just how the world worked: that the first thing you did, when facing any kind of challenge, was to figure out what the trick was for hacking the test. 

They were treating it like a test. They had learned how to "hack" good grades throughout their time in the school lives and now they were trying to do the same thing in their business lives.

>The most damaging thing you learned in school wasn't something you learned in any specific class. It was learning to get good grades.
