The forgetting curve is a work of experimental psychology by Hermann Ebbinghaus. It's often used to show that we forget what we've learned over time. People will also quote refer to the forgetting curve and quote statistics like ["within one hour, people will have forgotten an average of 50 percent of the information you presented"](https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1379/brain-science-the-forgetting-curvethe-dirty-secret-of-corporate-training) or _["learners will forget an average of 90% of what they have learned within the first month"](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/what-is-the-forgetting-curve/)_.

Marc Smith points out the issues with Ebbinghaus' study in his post [The Forgetting Curve: How Useful is it?](https://theemotionallearner.com/2021/03/24/the-forgetting-curve-how-useful-is-it/)

- There was only one participant in the study
- That once participant was Mr Ebbinghaus
- The information used in the study was stripped of meaning
	- Therefore the information has no utility to the participant
	- Without meaning there is no prior learning for the information to integrate with
- The findings can't be generalised to how things work in the real world

We don't forget information at a consistent rate. It's more complicated than that:

> ...information is lost over time, yet some seems to stick better than others because the new information is being integrated with previous learning. The time taken to forget is therefore dependent on more than just the passing of time and to think of it is such is to neglect these other important factors.
