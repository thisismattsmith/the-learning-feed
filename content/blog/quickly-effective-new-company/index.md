David McIver describes three key principles he uses to become effective quickly at a new job:

1. Acquire as little information as possible
2. Acquire information as efficiently as possible
3. Use the information you acquire as effectively as possible

He believes that learns what he needs to do to be effective and avoids anything outside of that.

>The thing about information is that once you have acquired it you can build on it. Every little bit of knowledge you put into your head provides you with a framework on which to hang more knowledge.

This constraint of _as little information as possible_ also mean he has to be very midnful of what information he learns.

So if this approach works, what does that mean for how we design onboarding programmes?

Do online courses follow this process?
