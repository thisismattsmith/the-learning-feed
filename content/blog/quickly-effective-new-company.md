David McIver describes three key principles he uses to become effective quickly at a new job:

1. Acquire as little information as possible
2. Acquire information as efficiently as possible
3. Use the information you acquire as effectively as possible

He suggests acquiring _as little information as possible_ because it means you focus on getting the right information, i.e., information you can use straight away. This helps you to work fast, avoid overwhelm and cut out distractions.
<br />
<br />
With this approach you're not overloading yourself with information. It's more mindful and intentional. You're incrementally building your knowledge base with what you need to know right now.

>The thing about information is that once you have acquired it you can build on it. Every little bit of knowledge you put into your head provides you with a framework on which to hang more knowledge.

So if David's method works, what does that mean for how we design onboarding?
