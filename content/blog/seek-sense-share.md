Harold Jarche's [Seek > Sense > Share Framework](https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/) is straightforward, yet powerful.

- Seek: finding things out
- Sense: understanding, personalizing and putting it into practice
- Share: exhanging your resources and insights with your network and collaborators
