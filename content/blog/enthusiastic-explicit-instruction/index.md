<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The thing I like most about the video is the energy and interactivity he brings. Explicit instruction isn&#39;t dull or stilted. It&#39;s dynamic, engaging and highly dialogic. And it gives students an amazing sense of achievement- look what you can do! <a href="https://t.co/cH8tej7FgA">https://t.co/cH8tej7FgA</a></p>&mdash; Adam Boxer (@adamboxer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamboxer1/status/1453400746792259587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></blockquote>

This is ceratinly a great example of engaging explicit instuction. Not only is he enthusiastic and charismatic but he also does many other things well:

- He assesses the student's current skill 
- She gets feedback and can see her own skill discrepancies
- He presents techniques to fix skill descrepancies.
- She pratices with the new techniques and sees immediate results
