In the book _Don't go back to school_ Kio Stark makes the following observation:

> Independent learners are interdependent learners.

Although autodidacts may take great pride in being 'self-taught', Kio says they're not doing it alone.

> That’s the open secret of learning outside of school. It’s a social act. Learning is something we do together.
