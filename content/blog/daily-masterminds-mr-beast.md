Jimmy Donaldson (Mr Beast) is one of the world's most successful YouTubers and he credits most of his growth and knowledge to what he calls *Daily Masterminds*. 
<br></br>

He gathered a group of other aspiring YouTubers who were as obsessive as he was and they'd talk every day to discuss and dissect YouTube videos.

<br></br>

>We basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row and did nothing but just like hyper-study what makes a good video.... we [would] do things like just take a thousand thumbnails and see if like there's a correlation to the brightness of the thumbnail to how many views it got or [analyze] videos that get over 10 million views [and figure out] how often they cut the camera angles.
<p class="quoted">Mr Beast</p>

<br></br>
They'd also talk about their own work; what was working for them and what mistakes they were each making.
<br></br>

Before starting the daily masterminds each member had around 10-20,000 subscribers. By the time they stopped they all had millions of subscribers each.
