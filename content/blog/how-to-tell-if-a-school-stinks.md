As an author, John Marsden has visited hundreds of schools throughout his career and has picked up as few ways of quickly determining the quality of a school.
<br />
<br />
One of those ways is to find out how clean and well maintained the children's restrooms are.

>The quality of the lavatory facilities is a good indicator of the regard in which children are held in a school; far better than any number of glossy brochures stuffed with photos carefully calculated and staged to show the gender and ethnic mix the school believes will be most attractive to the customers they want to enrol.

As the founder of two schools - [Candlebark](https://www.candlebark.info/) and [Alice Miller](https://www.alicemillerschool.com/aboutus/) - he practices what he preaches.
<br />
<br />
The restrooms at his school are clean because the [students clean them](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/students-scrub-toilets-at-candlebark-school-to-learn-adults-arent-their-servants-20150804-giqxm6.html#ixzz3qM6ddx00).
