      <h5>How can I get my content featured on The Learning Feed?</h5>
      <p>Make something interesting about Learning and Development! If it's good it will eventually end up here. 
      <br />
      It would be especially wonderful to feature ideas from real world case studies but there seems to be a global shortage. Maybe you could write some? ðŸ˜‰</p>
      <h5>Why are some articles, books, videos and podcasts referenced multiple times?</h5>
      <p>Each post discusses a single idea from a source. Some sources are so good they have multiple great ideas.</p>
